# Segment Anything and YoloV8 Collaboration

This project utilizes the combination of Segment Anything and YOLOV8 algorithms for airplane segmentation. It automatically identifies and segments airplanes in images, highlighting them regionally. This helps in monitoring the airspace and analyzing the presence of airplanes in a given scene.
